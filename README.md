# Minimum and Maximum Sum

This repository contains a function called `miniMaxSum` that calculates the minimum and maximum values that can be obtained by summing exactly four out of five positive integers.

## Function Description

The `miniMaxSum` function takes the following parameter:

- `arr`: an array of 5 positive integers.

It prints:

- Two space-separated long integers: the minimum sum and the maximum sum of 4 out of 5 elements in the array.

## Input Format

The input format for this function includes:

- A single line containing five space-separated integers.

## Output Format

The function prints two space-separated long integers denoting the respective minimum and maximum values that can be calculated by summing exactly four of the five integers. The output can be greater than a 32-bit integer, so it uses 64-bit integers to avoid integer overflow.

## Constraints

None
